Tron Light Cycle is a 2 to 4-player game. Each player spawns as a light cycle on the field. Their objective is to kill each other before being killed by using their trails. The players battle it out in a best-of-5 format, with the first player to 3 rounds winning the game. Each game affects the players' stats, which can be viewed in the player profile page.

Movement is controlled by AD. The trail is created as the light cycle automatically moves forwards. Players must force their opponents into their own trail, and avoid enemy trails in order to survive and win.
